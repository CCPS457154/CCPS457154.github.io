       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>In my personal carrier I am working on being an athlete. If that doesn't go as planned the I will peruse the carrier of being on engineer/mechanic. I chose the se two because I enjoy doing them both.  I am working towards these goals by training and learning. I train on and off the field. As for engineering I learn a few thing here and there from YouTube and actually working on something. In the future a short term goal I want to accomplish Is receiving an offer to play college football. I also want to take advantage of opportunities in the world of engineering to have a carrier to look forward to when I am older. I want to be able to make sure my family is straight. Everybody wants to the person that everyone loves and admires ant want to belike them. I want to be remembered as the person that put the work and effort. All that fame stuff doesn't really matter to me I just want to achieve what I came for. And by doing that I'll be doing something that I enjoy and not some thing that doesn't interest me.
